double data rate — this means that data are sent twice as frequently as the nominal clock rate would suggest — that is, on the rising slope as well as on the falling slope of the clock signal (see the lecture “Integrated circuits”),

Other important properties of the SDRAM type memory are:

* interleaving — allows more than one read/write operation at a time;

* returning data in the form of multi-byte chunks (which is desirable because, as soon as a particular memory cell is fetched, its neighbors are also likely to be soon needed).

During its evolution, DDR SDRAM has existed in the following configurations:

* DDR SDRAM (bandwidth: from 1,600 MB/s to 3,200 MB/s);

* DDR2 SDRAM (bandwidth: from 3,200MB/s to 8,533MB/s);

* DDR3 SDRAM (bandwidth: from 6,400MB/s to 19,200MB/s);

* DDR4 SDRAM (bandwidth: from 12,800MB/s to 25,600MB/s);
